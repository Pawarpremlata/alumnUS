Introduction:
An evolutionary alumni management system is a software that helps schools and universities to effectively connect with their alumni i.e. their ex-students. It is a system that helps all the passed out students to be socially connected with each other and are kept upto date about various events going on.
The purpose of our system is to improve and add efficient features for betterment of alumni management.

Advantages:
1.	A (Huge) Network
2.	Career Services
3.	Lifelong Email or Email Forwarding
4.	Job Opportunities


Existing System:

Existing system is a manual one which is used to store the information like colleges details of the alumni, student details and students ID.
More manual hours need to generate required reports and there is no pictorial representation.
There is no option such as feedback form.
Many colleges maintain present and old students manually. Re collecting this data in the manual system is very difficult. If student needs any data about old students they have to approach college management. Overall collecting the information is very tedious task in this system.


Proposed System:

•	This project allows students to register through online.
•	The students can easily access old students data.
•	Students can directly communicate with old students regarding Job, or any enquiry.
•	This system will also update the alumni in case of any new job opportunities or new events
•	System can send bulk Emails to any number of students hence increasing reliability


What is our system (Features of our system):

This application keeps the data in a centralized way which is available to all the users simultaneously.

One more feature added in our system is that after taking feedback from the students we generate pictorial reports so as to understand and make the system more better for the benefit of the students.
